## How to contribute

It's very easy to contribute to this project. You just need to make sure you read and understand the development guidelines, test everything on your localhost, and send a PR(Pull Request) from your branch to the **main** branch.

When you send a PR, you need to make sure:

- to include detailed information in the PR about what feature/bug you created/fixed
- to include screenshots for the feature/bug fixing if it's UI related
- sufficient unit test coverage for your code (min. 90% coverage)
- to add the translation items if any ([See how to add translation items](#i18n-localization))
- inform the code owner to review your PR

### Development environment

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- MySQL 8
- Remix v2

Run the dev server:

```shellscript
yarn dev
```

### MVC pattern

We adopt the MVC pattern to structure our codebase:

M(Model) - we handle all the database queries, data modeling here. You can find all the models in the **/app/models.ts** file

V(View) - The presentation layer. All the UI related React components are stored under the **/app/themes** directory. We already have the **default** theme, and you can create your own theme to suit your needs. ([See how to create your own theme](#creating-a-new-theme)). There are some guideline you need to follow when you are working on the View layer.

- Every route should match to a React page component under **/app/themes/<theme name>/pages**, e.g. the URL https://your-domain.com/cart requires a matching page component **/app/themes/<theme name>/pages/storefront/Cart.tsx**, https://your-domain.com/admin/settings matches to the page component **/app/themes/<theme name>/pages/admin/Settings.tsx**
- We use Tailwind CSS + shadcn UI library for frontend development, and we seperate the pre-built components and customized components strictly:

  - All the files with the **lowercase names** under the **/app/themes/<theme name>/components/ui** directory are the pre-built shadcn UI components, and you shall NOT modify those files directly. such as **/app/themes/<theme name>/components/ui/card.tsx** is a pre-built shadcn component, which you're not supposed to modify it directly.
  - All the files with **TitleCase names** are the customized UI components, such as **/app/themes/<theme name>/components/ui/storefront/Header.tsx**, are maintained by Cachaca contributors.

  When you need to create a new React component, you should follow this convention.

C(Controller) - All the files under the **/app/routes** directory are the controller files. What controllers do is to send the data from Models to Views. Please read the [Remix doc](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/discussion/routes) to learn how routing works.

### Database

We use MySQL database as the default database. It's recommended to use Docker containers for your local development to ensure consistency of development environment among contributors.

To set up the database using Docker, first make sure you have the database environment variables configured in your **.env** file under the root directory.

Then, you can run the following command:

```shellscript
docker compose up -d
```

The default template of the **.env** file

```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=<database user password>
DB_NAME=<database name>
JWT_TOKEN_SECRET=<a long random string that is used to sign JWT auth token>
SESSION_COOKIE_SECRET=<a long random string that is used to sign cookie message>
```

Next, run the following command to push the schema to your local database and seed the common tables:

```shellscript
yarn db:push
yarn db:seed
```

#### Updating database schemas

When you need to add new tables or alter the existing tables in the database, you shall do it through our database migration script instead of doing it yourself manually.

First, you need to add your changes to the **/db/schema.ts** file. And then run the following command to migrate the changes(means exporting the changes to a new .sql file):

```shellscript
yarn db:migrate
```

Once the step above is done, run the following command to push the changes to your local database

```shellscript
yarn db:push
```

Remember to commit your changes to your branch

### File hosting

Cachaca is designed to be deployed in different environments including Serverless environments, therefore, it is our design decision to use a file/object hosting service to host all multimedia files such as product images, audio/video files etc.

By default, Cachaca uses [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/pricing) as it provides a free tier and user friendly integration.

You can also use other file/object storage service providers by customizing the integration yourself:

- [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) - 12 months free tier available
- [Google cloud storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/pricing#price-tables)
- Many more...

### i18n localization

We use the **remix-i18next** package. To add a translation item, you should:

1. Create a new **<language code>.json** file under the _**/public/i18n/**_ directory if the file does not exist yet, and make sure you copy all the translation keys from the _**/public/i18n/en.json**_ file. For example, to add Japanese as a new language, you need to create **ja.json** under the _**/public/i18n/**_ directory, and make sure to copy all the tranlation keys from _**/public/i18n/en.json**_ file to the new **ja.json** file.

2. Follow the naming convention for the translation keys:

   - All pre-defined translation keys have the **system.** prefix, for example, **system.login** is translated as **Login** in English. These keys are used for the static instructions/description of the UI components.

   - If you wish to add your own UI components with new translation items, please use the prefix **custom.**. For instance, if you want to add translation for the word **Dropshipping**, you should add a new key `{"custom.dropshipping": "Dropshipping"}` in the xx.json files.

3. Add the new language code as a supported language in the **/app/i18n.ts** file.

### Customization

Cachaca allows you to develop your own themes and plugins on top of default UI components and features to a great extent. However, there are a few development guidelines you should adopt in order to keep this project scalable and maintainable.

#### Creating a new theme

If you wish to create a custom theme for any reasons, you shall follow the guidelines below:

- Create a new directory under the **/app/themes** directory with the name of your theme, for instance, if you want to create a new theme called **Urban**, you should create a new directory named **urban** _**(all theme names should be in lower case)**_ and the directory structure will look like this **/app/themes/urban**.

- In your own theme directory, you should separate your UI components into **components** and **pages**, where components consists of common React UI components and shadcn components, and pages directory consists of container components of each **Route**, for instance, one of the pre-defined routes **/app/routes/cart.tsx** invokes the **<Cart {...props} />** container component from the **/app/themes/default/pages/storefront/Cart.tsx** file.

- If you only wanted to customize the UI components for storefront, and use the default components from the **default** theme, you can copy the rest of the directories and files into your own theme directory.

- Make sure you add all the new translation keys under the **/public/i18n/** directory accordingly.

### Unit test

It's important to ensure the UI components and backend services are well tested. We aim to achieve **90%** test coverage for the entire codebase for RC1.

For Frontend, we use [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) for component testing

For Backend, we rely on Jest built-in functions + our own [mockdata](./mockdata/) for function and model testing

## Deployment

If you plan to host the system mannually, you can simply configure the environment variable in your server, and

- Build your app for production:

```sh
yarn build
```

- Run the app in production mode:

```sh
yarn start
```

You are recommended to use our auto deployment feature (WIP), and you can easily deploy your store within a minutes.

Some recommended painless **Serverless** options:

### Web hosting

- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - The demo app is currenlty running on Netlify's free-tier

### Database hosting

- [TiDB serverless](https://www.pingcap.com/tidb-serverless/) - A MySQL compatible serverless database service provider, the demo database is currently running on TiDB's free-tier
